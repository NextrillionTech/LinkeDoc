## Critical Rendering Path (CRP) Optimization

The Critical Rendering Path dictates how quickly the browser converts HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into painted pixels. 

### DOs
*   **DO inline critical CSS**: Extract styles necessary for above-the-fold content and inject them directly into the HTML `<head>`. Defer the rest of the stylesheet.
*   **DO use `async` or `defer` for all non-critical scripts**: Prevent JavaScript from blocking the DOM parser. Use `defer` for scripts that depend on the DOM or each other, and `async` for independent scripts. `type="module"` is preferred for modern JavaScript and is deferred by default so no need to have an explicit `defer` attribute but you can use `async` on independent module scripts.
*   **DO split CSS by media queries**: Use the `media` attribute on `<link>` tags so the browser downloads unused stylesheets (e.g., print styles or desktop styles on mobile) without blocking the render.
*   **DO utilize resource hints**: Add `preconnect` or `dns-prefetch` for essential third-party domains (e.g., font foundries or API endpoints) to establish early TLS handshakes.

### DON'Ts
*   **DON'T use `@import` in CSS**: This creates sequential request chains that delay the CSS Object Model (CSSOM) construction.
*   **DON'T place large, non-critical JavaScript in the `<head>`**: This halts DOM construction until the script is downloaded, parsed, and executed.
*   **DON'T load invisible or unreachable CSS/JS**: Ensure build tools apply tree-shaking and CSS minification to drop unreachable code before deployment.

### Code Examples

**HTML: Deferring Non-Critical CSS & Scripts**
```html
<!-- Inline critical styles directly in head -->
<style>
  body { margin: 0; font-family: system-ui; }
  .hero { min-height: 100vh; }
</style>

<!-- Defer non-critical CSS -->
<link rel="preload" href="non-critical.css" as="style" onload="this.onload=null;this.rel='stylesheet'">
<noscript><link rel="stylesheet" href="non-critical.css"></noscript>

<!-- Load CSS conditionally based on viewport -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="mobile.css" media="(max-width: 768px)">

<!-- Defer JavaScript execution -->
<script defer src="app-bundle.js"></script>
```

### The Resource Hint Navigator

| Hint | Tool Use Case | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `preconnect` | Resolve TLS/DNS for known third-party APIs | API endpoints, font services |
| `dns-prefetch` | Lean fallback for non-critical third-party origins | Ad servers, analytics fallbacks |
| `preload` | Same-origin asset needed *now* for rendering | Hero images, render-blocking fonts |
| `prefetch` | Assets needed for next-page navigation | Next-page bundle, detail views |

**Single-Sentence Mental Model**: "Preconnect for domains, Preload for viewport, Prefetch for futures."

## Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) & Resource Fetching

LCP measures the time required to render the largest visible text or image block within the viewport. Optimize LCP by prioritizing visible elements and prepolishing.

### DOs
*   **DO use `fetchpriority="high"` on the LCP image**: Signal to the browser's heuristic engine to elevate the image's priority above scripts and non-critical assets.
*   **DO declare the LCP image in standard HTML**: Ensure the `<img>` tag is present in the raw HTML response so the preload scanner discovers it immediately. Avoid relying on JavaScript to mount the LCP element.
*   **DO preload background images acting as LCP**: If the LCP element is a CSS `background-image`, force early discovery using `<link rel="preload" as="image">` coupled with `fetchpriority="high"`.
*   **DO use `fetchpriority="low"` to demote competing elements**: Lower the priority of large images or carousels that appear above the fold but are *not* the primary LCP element.

### DON'Ts
*   **DON'T lazy-load the LCP image**: Never apply `loading="lazy"` to above-the-fold images. This purposefully delays the fetch until layout calculation is complete, severely degrading LCP.
*   **DON'T overuse `fetchpriority="high"`**: Prioritization is a zero-sum mechanism. Elevating too many resources creates network contention and negates the benefit.
*   **DON'T implement complex JavaScript loaders for the hero section**: Client-side rendering of the LCP element introduces substantial request chains (HTML -> JS -> Execution -> Image Request).

### Code Examples

**HTML: LCP Image Optimization**
```html
<!-- Standard LCP Image -->
<img 
  src="/images/hero.webp" 
  alt="Hero Product" 
  fetchpriority="high" 
  decoding="sync"
  width="1200" 
  height="600"
>

<!-- Preloading a CSS-based LCP background -->
<link rel="preload" as="image" href="/images/bg-hero.webp" fetchpriority="high" type="image/webp">

<!-- Demoting an above-the-fold non-LCP carousel image -->
<img src="/images/carousel-2.webp" fetchpriority="low" alt="Slide 2">
```

## Interaction to Next Paint (INP) & Main Thread Unblocking

INP measures the latency of all interactive events across the page's lifecycle. Poor INP is caused by long-running JavaScript tasks blocking the main thread. 

### DOs
*   **DO break up long tasks**: Any JavaScript execution exceeding 50ms should be split. Yield to the main thread frequently so the browser can process pending user inputs.
*   **DO use `scheduler.yield()` with a fallback**: Utilize the modern `scheduler.yield()` API to place task continuations at the *front* of the queue, falling back to `setTimeout` wrapped in a Promise for unsupported browsers.
*   **DO debounce or throttle rapid event listeners**: Limit the execution frequency of handlers attached to `scroll`, `resize`, or rapid `input` events.
*   **DO separate UI updates from heavy computations**: Update the UI synchronously to provide immediate visual feedback, then push background processing to a Web Worker or deferred task.

### DON'Ts
*   **DON'T rely solely on `setTimeout(..., 0)` for continuous yielding**: Standard `setTimeout` places continuations at the *back* of the task queue, potentially causing long delays if other tasks are pending.
*   **DON'T cause layout thrashing**: Avoid interleaving DOM reads (`offsetHeight`, `getBoundingClientRect`) and writes (`style.height`) within the same loop. Batch DOM reads, then batch DOM writes.
*   **DON'T block the thread with recurring timers**: Avoid heavy polling with `setInterval` that starves the main thread.

### Code Examples

**JS: `scheduler.yield` Polyfill and Usage**
```javascript
// Polyfill for yielding to main thread
async function yieldToMain() {
  if ('scheduler' in window && 'yield' in scheduler) {
    return await scheduler.yield();
  }
  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 0));
}

// Processing a large array without blocking user input
async function processLargeList(items) {
  for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
    processItem(items[i]);
    
    // Yield every 50 iterations to allow rendering/interaction
    if (i % 50 === 0) {
      await yieldToMain();
    }
  }
}
```

### Main Thread Task Slicing Heuristic

**The 50ms Rule for INP**:
- **< 50ms**: Execute synchronously.
- **50ms - 250ms**: Slice tasks and yield with `scheduler.yield()`.
- **> 250ms**: Offload to a Web Worker.

## Third-Party Script Management

Third-party scripts (analytics, ads, chat widgets) are the primary source of main thread congestion.

### DOs
*   **DO avoid third-party scripts blocking main content**: Use `defer` with all third-party scripts unless critical to the page load and load them in the footer of the page, rather than the `<head>`.
*   **DO self-host critical third-party dependencies**: Reduce DNS lookups and enforce custom `Cache-Control` logic by hosting third-party libraries on the origin domain.

### Code Examples

**HTML: Third-Party Script Execution**
```html
<!-- 1. Place third-party scripts near the end of the page with the defer attribute -->
<script defer src="http://www.example.com/third-party.js"></script>
```

## CSS Rendering & Containment Optimization

Rendering involves Layout, Style, Paint, and Compositing calculations. CSS Containment limits the scope of these calculations which is useful on large, complex pages where such calculations can cause performance problems.

### DOs
*   **DO use `content-visibility: auto` on off-screen sections on large, complex pages**: Instruct the browser to skip layout and paint calculations for entire subtrees until they approach the viewport.
*   **DO pair `content-visibility` with `contain-intrinsic-size`**: Prevent layout shifts and scrollbar jumping by providing a placeholder height/width for unrendered containers.
*   **DO apply explicit CSS containment (`contain`)**: For isolated UI components (like modals or widgets), use `contain: layout style paint` to prevent internal changes from triggering page-wide reflows.

### DON'Ts
*   **DON'T apply `content-visibility: auto` on smaller, simpler pages**: The gains will be negligible and there are risks of side effects with content jumping.
*   **DON'T apply `content-visibility: auto` to above-the-fold content**: The browser will still evaluate it, but forcing it through the containment engine unnecessarily adds slight overhead to visible elements.
*   **DON'T overuse `will-change` globally**: Indiscriminately applying `will-change: transform` to multiple elements consumes excessive VRAM, causing GPU crashes or sluggish rendering.
*   **DON'T forget accessibility when hiding elements**: `content-visibility: auto` keeps elements in the DOM for screen readers. If content should be truly hidden from assistive technology when off-screen, manage `aria-hidden` attributes manually.

### Code Examples

**CSS: Content Visibility and Containment**
```css
/* Optimize a long list of articles below the fold */
.article-list-item {
  content-visibility: auto;
  contain-intrinsic-size: auto 600px; /* Provides a 600px placeholder */
}

/* Scope a complex widget to prevent layout thrashing */
.isolated-widget {
  contain: layout style paint;
}

/* Hardware accelerate an animation only on hover */
.interactive-button:hover {
  will-change: transform;
  transform: scale(1.05);
}
```

## Modern Image & Media Optimization

Images typically represent the largest payload on a given web page. Optimization requires format negotiation, responsive sizing, and layout stabilization.

### DOs
*   **DO serve modern formats (AVIF / WebP)**: Use the `<picture>` element to offer AVIF (best compression), falling back to WebP, and finally JPEG/PNG for legacy browsers.
*   **DO apply explicit `width` and `height` attributes**: Setting native attributes allows the browser to compute the aspect ratio immediately, reserving space and eliminating CLS. Image dimensions may be set either as HTML attributes or CSS properties.
*   **DO utilize `loading="lazy"` on all below-the-fold images**: Utilize native browser lazy loading to defer network requests for images outside the initial viewport.
*   **DO implement responsive images with `srcset` and `sizes`**: Serve tailored resolutions based on screen density and viewport width to prevent mobile devices from downloading desktop-sized images.

### DON'Ts
*   **DON'T lazy load above-the-fold images**: This directly harms LCP. Visible images must use `loading="eager"` (the default).
*   **DON'T delete necessary dimensions**: Failing to specify width/height on lazy loaded images causes layout shifts.
*   **DON'T omit the `sizes` attribute when using `srcset`**: Without `sizes`, the browser assumes `100vw` and downloads the largest available image.

### Code Examples

**HTML: Comprehensive Responsive Image Component**
```html
<picture>
  <!-- Modern Formats with Source Negotiation -->
  <source type="image/avif" srcset="hero-400w.avif 400w, hero-800w.avif 800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 50vw">
  <source type="image/webp" srcset="hero-400w.webp 400w, hero-800w.webp 800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 50vw">
  
  <!-- Fallback + Dimensions + Priority for Above-The-Fold -->
  <img 
    src="hero-800w.jpg" 
    alt="Descriptive text" 
    width="800" 
    height="600"
    fetchpriority="high"
    loading="eager"
  >
</picture>

<!-- Below-The-Fold Image -->
<img 
    src="footer-icon.png" 
    alt="Footer Logo" 
    width="100" 
    height="100"
    loading="lazy"
>

<!-- DO: Use native lazy loading for below the fold iframes -->
<iframe src="https://example.com/map" width="800" height="600" loading="lazy" title="Example Map"></iframe>
```

## Service Workers & Caching Strategies

Client-side caching via Service Workers allows applications to bypass the network entirely, serving resources from disk/memory.

### DOs
*   **DO use a `CacheFirst` strategy for static, versioned assets**: Immutable files (fonts, JS/CSS bundles with hash strings) should be served directly from the cache to guarantee instant loading.
*   **DO use `StaleWhileRevalidate` for dynamic, non-critical resources**: For API calls where slight staleness is acceptable, serve immediately from cache while silently updating the cache in the background.
*   **DO implement a `NetworkFirst` strategy for HTML documents**: Ensure the user always receives the latest application shell and manifest, falling back to cache only if offline.
*   **DO restrict cache sizes and expiry**: Use expiration plugins to prevent the Service Worker from exhausting the device's storage quota.

### DON'Ts
*   **DON'T cache opaque responses blindly**: Responses from third-party domains lacking CORS headers are "opaque". Caching them heavily consumes quota and fails silently. Only cache them using `NetworkFirst` or `StaleWhileRevalidate`.
*   **DON'T cache POST requests**: Service workers cannot cache non-GET requests natively. Implement background sync queues for offline submissions.
*   **DON'T bypass versioning**: Failing to update asset hashes/versions will trap users in infinite cache loops.

### Code Examples

**JS: Service Worker Caching via Workbox**
```javascript
import { registerRoute } from 'workbox-routing';
import { CacheFirst, StaleWhileRevalidate, NetworkFirst } from 'workbox-strategies';
import { ExpirationPlugin } from 'workbox-expiration';
import { CacheableResponsePlugin } from 'workbox-cacheable-response';

// 1. HTML Documents: Network First
registerRoute(
  ({ request }) => request.mode === 'navigate',
  new NetworkFirst({ cacheName: 'pages-cache' })
);

// 2. Static Assets (JS, CSS, Fonts): Cache First
registerRoute(
  ({ request }) => ['style', 'script', 'font'].includes(request.destination),
  new CacheFirst({
    cacheName: 'static-resources',
    plugins: [
      new CacheableResponsePlugin({ statuses: [0, 200] }),
      new ExpirationPlugin({ maxEntries: 50, maxAgeSeconds: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 })
    ]
  })
);

// 3. API Responses: Stale While Revalidate
registerRoute(
  ({ url }) => url.pathname.startsWith('/api/v1/content'),
  new StaleWhileRevalidate({
    cacheName: 'api-cache',
    plugins: [
      new CacheableResponsePlugin({ statuses: [0, 200] })
    ]
  })
);
```

## Web Fonts Optimization

Web fonts are a common source of render blocking. Optimizing them reduces the Flash of Invisible Text (FOIT) and speeds up initial rendering.

### DOs
*   **DO preload critical fonts**: Use `<link rel="preload" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>` for fonts seen above the fold.
*   **DO subset fonts**: Trim font weights and glyph variations to include only the characters your application requires.

### DON'Ts
*   **DON'T preload all fonts**: Over-preloading leads to network contention that starves other critical assets.

### Code Examples

**CSS: Font Loading Face**
```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Modern Sans';
  src: url('/fonts/modern-sans.woff2') format('woff2');
}
```

**HTML: Critical Font Preload**
```html
<!-- Always use crossorigin for fonts even if on the same origin -->
<link rel="preload" href="/fonts/modern-sans.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>
```

## Video Performance & Metrics

Video payloads are among the heaviest assets. Optimization focuses on reducing bandwidth stall and preserving Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) stability.

### DOs
*   **DO specify explicit `width` and `height` attributes**: Setting native dimensions reserves layout space and prevents CLS.
*   **DO provide a `poster` image fallback**: Display a lightweight image placeholder while the video buffers to improve perceived performance.
*   **DO use `preload="none"` for non-critical videos**: Delay bandwidth consumption for below-the-fold or non-autoplaying videos.
*   **DO serve modern formats via source negotiation**: Offer WebM (better compression ratio) alongside standard MP4 formats.
*   **DO use `loading="lazy"` for offscreen videos**: Lazy-loading videos allow `poster` and `preload` downloads to be deferred until the video is in or near the viewport.

### DON'Ts
*   **DON'T auto-play video files blindly**: Rely on user intent or use progressive enhancement streams.
*   **DON'T auto-play large video files at all**: Rely on user intent before downloading large files.

### Code Examples

**HTML: Accessible and Dynamic Video Loader**
```html
<video 
  controls 
  width="1200" 
  height="675"
  poster="/images/video-poster.webp" 
  preload="none"
>
  <source src="/videos/intro.webm" type="video/webm">
  <source src="/videos/intro.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <!-- Include accessibility tracks -->
  <track src="/video-caps.vtt" kind="captions" srclang="en" label="English">
</video>
```

## JavaScript Code-Splitting

Heavy monolithic bundles block main thread parse times on low-end devices. Splitting ensures we only download bytes required for the immediate viewport.

### DOs
*   **DO use dynamic imports**: Split routes or heavy UI libraries using standard `import()` specifications.
*   **DO configure bundler asset chunking**: Use Vite or Webpack rollup directives to split third-party vendors from runtime application logic.

### DON'Ts
*   **DON'T ship a single, enormous `app.js` bundle**: It increases parse time and memory consumption for initial views.

### Code Examples

**JS: Route based Dynamic Splitting**
```javascript
// Dynamic import of heavy module only when button is clicked
document.getElementById('heavy-btn').addEventListener('click', async () => {
  const { heavyFunction } = await import('./heavy-module.js');
  heavyFunction();
});
```


--- Guide for optimize-image-priority ---
# Optimize image priority

Browsers use heuristics to assign loading priorities to images, but these defaults may not always align with your page's Largest Contentful Paint (LCP). Using `fetchpriority` on an `<img>` element allows you to explicitly signal an image's importance to the browser, ensuring critical images load faster while non-essential ones don't compete for bandwidth.

## How to implement

1. **Identify the LCP image**: Determine which image is the most likely candidate for the Largest Contentful Paint (usually the hero image at the top of the page).
2. **Elevate LCP priority**: Add `fetchpriority="high"` to the `<img>` element for the LCP candidate.
3. **Deprioritize non-critical images**: For images that are part of a secondary UI or are only revealed after user interaction (like mega menus, modals, or off-screen carousel slides), add `fetchpriority="low"`.
4. **Optimize lazy loading**: Never use `loading="lazy"` on the LCP image. For standard below-the-fold images, `loading="lazy"` is sufficient to defer the request until the user scrolls near them. Avoid adding `fetchpriority="low"` to these images, as you want them to load at normal priority once the user scrolls to them. Reserve `fetchpriority="low"` for images that are technically "above the fold" but not initially visible (e.g., hidden carousel slides or mega menus). For these hidden images, it is acceptable to use `loading="lazy"` as well; the browser will handle the request timing while respecting the low priority.
5. **Prefer default priorities**: If an image should have normal loading priority, omit the `fetchpriority` attribute entirely rather than setting it to `auto`. This is a stylistic convention to keep your HTML cleaner while relying on the browser's native heuristics.

## Example code

```html
<!-- Elevate priority for the LCP image -->
<img src="/images/hero-lcp.jpg"
     alt="Main Banner"
     fetchpriority="high"
     width="800" height="400">

<!-- Deprioritize initially hidden images above the fold -->
<img src="/images/gallery-alt.jpg"
     alt="Gallery Image"
     fetchpriority="low"
     width="400" height="300">

<!-- Deprioritize images revealed only after user interaction -->
<img src="/images/mega-menu-promo.jpg"
     alt="Special Offer"
     fetchpriority="low"
     width="300" height="150">

<!-- Use lazy loading ALONE for standard below-the-fold images -->
<img src="/images/footer-logo.png"
     alt="Footer Logo"
     loading="lazy"
     width="120" height="60">

<!-- Omit fetchpriority for images with standard priority -->
<img src="/images/standard-image.jpg"
     alt="Standard Image"
     width="400" height="300">
```

## Best practices

- **MANDATORY**: Always apply `fetchpriority="high"` to the LCP image.
- **MANDATORY**: Only use `fetchpriority="high"` on at most 1-2 critical images to avoid network contention and diluting the priority boost.
- **MANDATORY**: Use `fetchpriority="low"` for images that are technically "above the fold" but initially hidden (e.g., hidden carousel slides, mega menu images).
- **MANDATORY**: **Do not** use `fetchpriority="low"` on standard below-the-fold images that are already using `loading="lazy"`. These images should load at normal priority once they enter the viewport.
- **RECOMMENDED**: Avoid using `fetchpriority="auto"`. If you want the default priority, omit the attribute entirely to keep your HTML clean.
- **DO NOT** combine `fetchpriority="high"` with `loading="lazy"` for the LCP image.
- **DO NOT** use the deprecated `importance` attribute. It has been replaced by `fetchpriority` and is not supported by any browser.

## Fallback strategy

Baseline status for Fetch priority: Newly available. It's been Baseline since 2024-10-29.
Supported by: Chrome 103 (Jun 2022), Edge 103 (Jun 2022), Firefox 132 (Oct 2024), and Safari 17.2 (Dec 2023).

The `fetchpriority` attribute is a progressive enhancement for the `<img>` element. If a browser does not support it, the attribute is ignored, and the browser uses its default priority heuristics.


--- Guide for autofill-sign-up-form ---
# Build a sign-up form that follows best practice

Use cross-platform browser features to build sign-up forms that are secure, accessible and easy to use.

If users ever need to sign up to your site, then good sign-up form design is critical. This is especially true for people on poor connections, on mobile, in a hurry, or under stress. Poorly designed sign-up forms get high bounce rates. Each bounce could mean a lost customer and a disgruntled user—not just a missed sign-up opportunity.

## How to implement

Outlined below are the most important guidelines for building successful sign-up forms.

### Use meaningful, valid HTML

Make the most of the elements and attributes built for creating forms:

-   `<form>`, `<input>`, `<label>`, and `<button>`
-   `type`, `autocomplete`, and `inputmode`

These enable built-in browser functionality, improve accessibility, and add meaning to markup.

### Use the `<label>` element to label form fields for data entry

To label an `<input>`, `<select>`, or `<textarea>`, use a `<label>`. Associate a label with an input by giving the label's `for` attribute the same value as the input's `id`.

### Make the most of HTML attributes

Make it easy for users to enter data, by using the appropriate `<input>` element `<type>` attribute to provide the right keyboard on mobile and enable basic built-in validation by the browser.

Always use `type="email"` for email addresses and `type="tel"` for phone numbers.

Every `<input>`, `<select>`, and `<textarea>` element SHOULD have an appropriate `autocomplete` attribute, to improve accessibility and help users avoid re-entering data.

### Make buttons helpful

Use `<button>` for buttons. You can also use `<input type="submit">`, but don't use a `div` or some other random element acting as a button. Button elements provide accessible behaviour, built-in form submission functionality, and can easily be styled.

Give each form submit button a value that says what it does. Use a clear, recognizable label. For example, use **Create account** or **Sign up** rather than **Continue** or **Submit**.

### Use a single name input where possible

Allow your users to enter their name using a single input, unless you have a good reason for separately storing given names, family names, honorifics, or other name parts. Using a single name input makes forms less complex, enables cut-and-paste, and makes autofill simpler.

Allow international names. For validation, avoid using regular expressions that only match Latin characters. Latin-only excludes users with names or addresses that include characters that aren't in the Latin alphabet. Allow Unicode letter matching instead—and ensure your backend supports Unicode securely as both input and output. Unicode in regular expressions is well supported by modern browsers.

### Show sign-up progress

For each step towards sign-up, use page headings and descriptive button values that make it clear what needs to be done now, and what the next step is.

Use the `enterkeyhint` attribute on form inputs to set the mobile keyboard enter key label. For example, use `enterkeyhint="previous"` and `enterkeyhint="next"` within a multi-page form, `enterkeyhint="done"` for the final input in the form, and `enterkeyhint="search"` for a search input.

### Help users avoid re-entering sign-up data

Make sure to add appropriate `autocomplete` values in sign-up forms.

This enables browsers to help users by securely storing sign-up details and correctly entering form data. Without autocomplete, users may be more likely to keep a physical record of sign-up details, or store sign-up data insecurely on their device.

### Validate carefully

Validate data entry both in realtime and before form submission. Use `type="email"` for email inputs — the browser will validate the format automatically. For passwords, use a `pattern` attribute to enforce strength requirements and provide clear error messages when validation fails. Add the `required` attribute to mandatory fields to prevent empty submissions.

### Put sign-up in its own `<form>` element

Always use the `<form>` element when you're getting users to enter data

Don't wrap inputs in a `<div>` and handle input data submission purely with JavaScript. It's generally better to use a `<form>` element. This makes your site accessible to screenreaders and other assistive devices, enables a range of built-in browser features, makes it simpler to build basic functional sign-up for older browsers, and can still work even if JavaScript fails.

### Don't double up inputs

Some sites force users to enter emails or passwords twice. That might reduce errors for a few users, but causes extra work for all users, and increases abandonment rates. Asking twice also makes no sense where browsers autofill email addresses or suggest strong passwords. It's better to enable users to confirm their email address (you'll need to do that anyway) and make it easy for them to reset their password if necessary.

### Keep passwords private—but enable users to see them if they want

Passwords inputs should have `type="password"` to hide password text and help the browser understand that the input is for passwords. (Note that browsers use a variety of techniques to understand input roles and decide whether or not to offer to save passwords.)

You should add a **Show password** toggle to enable users to check the text they've entered—and don't forget to add a **Forgot password** link.

### Give mobile users the right keyboard

Use `<input type="email">` to give mobile users an appropriate keyboard and enable basic built-in email address validation by the browser… no JavaScript required!

If you need to use a telephone number instead of an email address, `<input type="tel">` enables a telephone keypad on mobile. You can also use the `inputmode` attribute where necessary: `inputmode="numeric"` is ideal for PIN numbers.

### Prevent mobile keyboard from obstructing the Sign up button

If you're not careful, mobile keyboards may cover your form or, worse, partially obstruct the Sign up button. Users may give up before realizing what has happened.

Where possible, avoid this by displaying only the email (or phone) and password inputs and Sign up button at the top of your sign-up page. Put other content underneath.

### Help users to avoid re-entering data

You can help browsers store data correctly and autofill inputs, so users don't have to remember to enter email and password values. This is particularly important on mobile, and crucial for email inputs, which get high abandonment rates. There are two parts to this:

1.  The `autocomplete`, `name`, `id`, and `type` attributes help browsers understand the role of inputs in order to store data that can later be used for autofill. To allow data to be stored for autofill, modern browsers also require inputs to have a stable `name` or `id` value (not randomly generated on each page load or site deployment), and to be in a `<form>` element with a `submit` button.
1.  The `autocomplete` attribute helps browsers correctly autofill inputs using stored data.

For email inputs use `autocomplete="username"`, since `username` is recognized by password managers in modern browsers—even though you should use `type="email"` and you may want to use `id="email"` and `name="email"`. For password inputs, use the appropriate `autocomplete` and `id` values to help browsers differentiate between new and current passwords.

### Use autocomplete="new-password" and id="new-password" for a new password

MANDATORY: For a sign-up form, use `autocomplete="new-password"`.

```html
<!-- new-password prevents password managers from auto-filling an existing password into this field -->
<input type="password" id="new-password" name="new-password" autocomplete="new-password" required>
```

### Enable the browser to suggest a strong password

Modern browsers use heuristics to decide when to show the password manager UI and suggest a strong password.

Built-in browser password generators mean users and developers don't need to work out what a "strong password" is. Since browsers can securely store passwords and autofill them as necessary, there's no need for users to remember or enter passwords. Encouraging users to take advantage of built-in browser password generators also means they're more likely to use a unique, strong password on your site, and less likely to reuse a password that could be compromised elsewhere.

### Help save users from accidentally missing inputs

Add the `required` attribute to both email and password fields. Modern browsers automatically prompt and set focus for missing data.

### Allow password pasting

Some sites don't allow text to be pasted into password inputs.

Disallowing password pasting annoys users, encourages passwords that are memorable (and therefore may be easier to compromise) and, according to organizations such as the UK National Cyber Security Centre, may actually reduce security. Users only become aware that pasting is disallowed after they try to paste their password, so disallowing password pasting doesn't avoid clipboard vulnerabilities.

### Offer third-party login

Many users prefer to sign in to websites using an email address and password sign-up form. However, you should also enable users to sign in using a third-party identity provider, also known as federated login.

This approach has several advantages. For users who create an account using federated login, you don't need to ask for, communicate, or store passwords.

You may also be able to access additional verified profile information from federated login, such as an email address—which means the user doesn't have to enter that data and you don't need to do the verification yourself. Federated login can also make it much easier for users when they get a new device.

### Take care with usernames

Don't insist on a username unless (or until) you need one. Enable users to sign up and sign in with only an email address (or telephone number) and password—or federated login if they prefer. Don't force them to choose and remember a username.

If your site does require usernames, don't impose unreasonable rules on them, and don't stop users from updating their username. On your backend you should generate a unique ID for every user account, not an identifier based on personal data such as username.

Also make sure to use `autocomplete="username"` for usernames.

### Fallback strategies

Baseline status for Email, telephone, and URL <input> types: Widely available. It's been Baseline since 2015-07-29.
Supported by: Chrome 5 (May 2010), Edge 12 (Jul 2015), Firefox 4 (Mar 2011), Safari 5 (Jun 2010), and Safari iOS 3 (Jun 2009).
Baseline status for inputmode: Widely available. It's been Baseline since 2021-12-07.
Supported by: Chrome 66 (Apr 2018), Edge 79 (Jan 2020), Firefox 95 (Dec 2021), Safari 12.1 (Mar 2019), and Safari iOS 12.2 (Mar 2019).

Autofill is a progressive enhancement. In browsers that do not support autofill, users will simply need to manually enter their sign-up credentials. The semantic HTML constraints (such as `type`, `inputmode`, and `required`) will still function appropriately to validate user input and provide the correct virtual keyboards.

# Build a sign-in form that follows best practice

Use cross-platform browser features to build sign-in forms that are secure, accessible and easy to use.

If users ever need to sign in to your site, then good sign-in form design is critical. This is especially true for people on poor connections, on mobile, in a hurry, or under stress. Poorly designed sign-in forms get high bounce rates. Each bounce could mean a lost customer and a disgruntled user—not just a missed sign-in opportunity.

## How to implement

Outlined below are the most important guidelines for building successful sign-in forms.

### Use meaningful, valid HTML

Make the most of the elements and attributes built for creating forms:

- `<form>`, `<input>`, `<label>`, and `<button>`
- `type`, `autocomplete`, and `inputmode`

These enable built-in browser functionality, improve accessibility, and add meaning to markup.

### Use the `<label>` element to label form fields for data entry

To label an `<input>`, `<select>`, or `<textarea>`, use a `<label>`. Associate a label with an input by giving the label's `for` attribute the same value as the input's `id`.

### Make the most of HTML attributes

Make it easy for users to enter data, by using the appropriate `<input>` element `<type>` attribute to provide the right keyboard on mobile and enable basic built-in validation by the browser.

Always use `type="email"` for email addresses and `type="tel"` for phone numbers.

Every `<input>`, `<select>`, and `<textarea>` element SHOULD have an appropriate `autocomplete` attribute, to improve accessibility and help users avoid re-entering data.

### Make buttons helpful

Use `<button>` for buttons. You can also use `<input type="submit">`, but don't use a `div` or some other random element acting as a button. Button elements provide accessible behaviour, built-in form submission functionality, and can easily be styled.

Give each form submit button a value that says what it does. Use a clear, recognizable label. For example, use **Sign In** rather than **Continue** or **Submit**.

### Use a single name input where possible

Allow your users to enter their name using a single input, unless you have a good reason for separately storing given names, family names, honorifics, or other name parts. Using a single name input makes forms less complex, enables cut-and-paste, and makes autofill simpler.

Allow international names. For validation, avoid using regular expressions that only match Latin characters. Latin-only excludes users with names or addresses that include characters that aren't in the Latin alphabet. Allow Unicode letter matching instead—and ensure your backend supports Unicode securely as both input and output. Unicode in regular expressions is well supported by modern browsers.

### Show sign-in progress

For each step towards sign-in, use page headings and descriptive button values that make it clear what needs to be done now, and what the next step is.

Use the `enterkeyhint` attribute on form inputs to set the mobile keyboard enter key label. For example, use `enterkeyhint="previous"` and `enterkeyhint="next"` within a multi-page form, `enterkeyhint="done"` for the final input in the form, and `enterkeyhint="search"` for a search input.

### Help users avoid re-entering sign-in data

Make sure to add appropriate `autocomplete` values in sign-in forms.

This enables browsers to help users by securely storing sign-in details and correctly entering form data. Without autocomplete, users may be more likely to keep a physical record of sign-in details, or store sign-in data insecurely on their device.

### Validate carefully

Validate data entry both in realtime and before form submission. Use `type="email"` for email inputs — the browser will validate the format automatically. Add the `required` attribute to mandatory fields to prevent empty submissions.

### Put sign-in in its own `<form>` element

Always use the `<form>` element when you're getting users to enter data

Don't wrap inputs in a `<div>` and handle input data submission purely with JavaScript. It's generally better to use a `<form>` element. This makes your site accessible to screenreaders and other assistive devices, enables a range of built-in browser features, makes it simpler to build basic functional sign-in for older browsers, and can still work even if JavaScript fails.

### Don't double up inputs

Some sites force users to enter emails or passwords twice. That might reduce errors for a few users, but causes extra work for all users, and increases abandonment rates. Asking twice also makes no sense where browsers autofill email addresses or suggest strong passwords. It's better to enable users to confirm their email address (you'll need to do that anyway) and make it easy for them to reset their password if necessary.

### Keep passwords private—but enable users to see them if they want

Passwords inputs should have `type="password"` to hide password text and help the browser understand that the input is for passwords. (Note that browsers use a variety of techniques to understand input roles and decide whether or not to offer to save passwords.)

You should add a **Show password** toggle to enable users to check the text they've entered—and don't forget to add a **Forgot password** link.

### Give mobile users the right keyboard

Use `<input type="email">` to give mobile users an appropriate keyboard and enable basic built-in email address validation by the browser… no JavaScript required!

If you need to use a telephone number instead of an email address, `<input type="tel">` enables a telephone keypad on mobile. You can also use the `inputmode` attribute where necessary: `inputmode="numeric"` is ideal for PIN numbers.

### Prevent mobile keyboard from obstructing the Sign in button

If you're not careful, mobile keyboards may cover your form or, worse, partially obstruct the Sign in button. Users may give up before realizing what has happened.

Where possible, avoid this by displaying only the email (or phone) and password inputs and Sign in button at the top of your sign-in page. Put other content underneath.

### Help users to avoid re-entering data

You can help browsers store data correctly and autofill inputs, so users don't have to remember to enter email and password values. This is particularly important on mobile, and crucial for email inputs, which get high abandonment rates. There are two parts to this:

1.  The `autocomplete`, `name`, `id`, and `type` attributes help browsers understand the role of inputs in order to store data that can later be used for autofill. To allow data to be stored for autofill, modern browsers also require inputs to have a stable `name` or `id` value (not randomly generated on each page load or site deployment), and to be in a `<form>` element with a `submit` button.
1.  The `autocomplete` attribute helps browsers correctly autofill inputs using stored data.

For email inputs use `autocomplete="username"`, since `username` is recognized by password managers in modern browsers—even though you should use `type="email"` and you may want to use `id="email"` and `name="email"`. For password inputs, use the appropriate `autocomplete` and `id` values to help browsers differentiate between new and current passwords.

### Use autocomplete="current-password" and id="current-password" for an existing password

MANDATORY: Use `autocomplete="current-password"` and `id="current-password"` for the password input in a sign-in form. This tells the browser that you want it to use the current password that it has stored for the site.

For a sign-in form:

```
<input type="password" autocomplete="current-password" id="current-password" …>
```

### Enable the browser to suggest a strong password

Modern browsers use heuristics to decide when to show the password manager UI and suggest a strong password.

Built-in browser password generators mean users and developers don't need to work out what a "strong password" is. Since browsers can securely store passwords and autofill them as necessary, there's no need for users to remember or enter passwords. Encouraging users to take advantage of built-in browser password generators also means they're more likely to use a unique, strong password on your site, and less likely to reuse a password that could be compromised elsewhere.

### Help save users from accidentally missing inputs

MANDATORY: Add the `required` attribute to both email and password fields. Modern browsers automatically prompt and set focus for missing data.

```html
<input type="email" id="email" name="email" autocomplete="username" required>
<input type="password" id="password" name="password" autocomplete="current-password" required>
```

### Allow password pasting

Some sites don't allow text to be pasted into password inputs.

Disallowing password pasting annoys users, encourages passwords that are memorable (and therefore may be easier to compromise) and, according to organizations such as the UK National Cyber Security Centre, may actually reduce security. Users only become aware that pasting is disallowed after they try to paste their password, so disallowing password pasting doesn't avoid clipboard vulnerabilities.

### Fallback strategies

Baseline status for Email, telephone, and URL <input> types: Widely available. It's been Baseline since 2015-07-29.
Supported by: Chrome 5 (May 2010), Edge 12 (Jul 2015), Firefox 4 (Mar 2011), Safari 5 (Jun 2010), and Safari iOS 3 (Jun 2009).
Baseline status for inputmode: Widely available. It's been Baseline since 2021-12-07.
Supported by: Chrome 66 (Apr 2018), Edge 79 (Jan 2020), Firefox 95 (Dec 2021), Safari 12.1 (Mar 2019), and Safari iOS 12.2 (Mar 2019).

Autofill is a progressive enhancement. In browsers that do not support autofill, users will simply need to manually enter their sign-in credentials. The semantic HTML constraints (such as `type`, `inputmode`, and `required`) will still function appropriately to validate user input and provide the correct virtual keyboards.


--- Guide for forms ---
## 1. Semantic Structure and Form Element

### Guidelines

- **DO** use the `<form>` element to wrap interactive controls for data collection.
- **DO** use `method="POST"` for sensitive data and mutations; use `method="GET"` for idempotent requests (e.g., search).
- **DO** specify the `action` attribute for the destination URL.
- **DO** specify a `name` attribute for every form control to identify data on submission.
- **DO** use semantic tags like `<button type="submit">`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>`.
- **DO** use `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` to group related controls.
- **DO** use actionable language on submit buttons (e.g., "Save changes").

- **DON'T** use `GET` for sensitive data (it exposes data in history/logs).
- **DON'T** use generic `<div>` or `<span>` for form controls.
- **DON'T** use `type="button"` for primary submission buttons.
- **DON'T** disable textarea resizing without alternate layout provisions.

### Code Example

```html
<form action="/search" method="GET">
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Search Preferences</legend>
    <label for="q">Query:</label>
    <input type="text" id="q" name="q" required>
    <button type="submit">Search</button>
  </fieldset>
</form>
```

### Selection Control Decision Matrix

| Options Count | Choice Type | Recommended Element | Usability & Accessibility Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1–5** | Single (Exclusive) | `<input type="radio">` | **Zero-click scanning**: All choices are immediately visible. Faster scan time. |
| **6+** | Single (Exclusive) | `<select>` | **Space conservation**: Use only when vertical space is premium or the list is long. |
| **10+ / Dynamic** | Single (Exclusive) | `<input list="id">` (`<datalist>`) | **Fuzzy Search**: Prevents scrolling fatigue in massive sets (e.g., countries). |
| **Any** | Multi-select | `<input type="checkbox">` | **Standard semantics**: Native non-exclusive toggles. |

**Single-Sentence Mental Model**: "Expose mutually exclusive options as visible radio buttons when choices are fewer than six; use `<select>` only when space is constrained or the list is long."

## 2. Accessible Labeling and State

### Guidelines

- **DO** always associate `<label>` with its input using `for` and `id`.
- **DO** place labels above form controls to enable faster scanning.
- **DO** use visible labels; do not rely on `placeholder` alone.
- **DO** ensure the vertical margin between a label and its input is less than the margin between form groups (**Gestalt Proximity Rule**).
- **DO** use `aria-describedby` to link inputs with help text or error messages.
- **DO** define the `lang` attribute on `<html>` for proper device translation.
- **DO** use non-color visual cues (icons, text) to communicate state (don't rely on color alone).
- **DO** indicate clearly which fields are required.
- **DO** use `aria-live` for dynamic error announcements.

- **DON'T** use `placeholder` as a replacement for labels.
- **DON'T** use `aria-label` as the sole text description if translation is needed.
- **DON'T** disable focus outlines without providing a high-contrast alternative.

### Code Example

```html
<div class="field">
  <label for="username">Username:</label>
  <input type="text" id="username" name="username" aria-describedby="user-help" required>
  <span id="user-help" class="hint">3-12 characters.</span>
</div>

<style>
  input:focus-visible {
    outline: 3px solid #0b57d0;
    outline-offset: 2px;
  }
</style>
```

## 3. Autofill and Input Modes

### Guidelines

- **DO** use the `autocomplete` attribute to specify expected data (e.g., `email`, `tel`, `current-password`, `new-password`).
- **DO** use `inputmode` to optimize on-screen keyboards (e.g., `inputmode="numeric"` for PINs).
- **DO** use `enterkeyhint` to set the Enter key label (e.g., `next`, `done`).
- **DO** use single-field inputs for complex numbers (credit cards, phones) to help autofill.

- **DON'T** use `type="number"` for credit cards or ZIP codes (causes UI scroll issues and removes leading zeros).

### Code Example

```html
<label for="zip">ZIP Code:</label>
<input type="text" id="zip" name="zip" autocomplete="postal-code" inputmode="numeric" pattern="\d{5}">
```

## 4. Constraints and Validation

### Guidelines

- **DO** use native constraints: `required`, `minlength`, `maxlength`, `pattern`.
- **DO** use CSS pseudo-classes `:invalid:user-invalid` for non-intrusive styling.
- **DO** use the ValidityState API (`setCustomValidity`) for custom messaging.

- **DON'T** disable submit buttons to block validation; let users submit and highlight errors. However, **DO** disable the button *after* a valid submission is clicked to prevent double-posts.

### Code Example

```html
<label for="code">Activation Code (4 digits):</label>
<input type="text" id="code" name="code" required pattern="\d{4}">

<script>
  const input = document.getElementById('code');
  input.addEventListener('invalid', () => {
    input.setCustomValidity('Please enter exactly 4 digits.');
  });
  input.addEventListener('input', () => {
    input.setCustomValidity('');
  });
</script>
```

### Validation Event Timing Matrix

| Event Trigger | Phase | Action Allowed | UX / Accessibility Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`input`** | Active Typing | **Clear** existing errors only. | **Non-intrusive**: Do not yell at the user before they finish typing. |
| **`blur` / `focusout`** | Exiting Field | **Run** check and show error. | **Contextual validation**: Validate once the user indicates they are "done" with a field. |
| **`submit`** | Final Attempt | **Block** and route focus. | **Final gatekeeper**: Intercepts bad payloads and forces screen reader focus to the summary. |

**Single-Sentence Mental Model**: "Validate on `blur` to avoid premature warnings while typing, and reset error states on `input` as soon as the user attempts a correction."

**Security vs UX Scale**: Client-side validation is for User Experience; Server-side validation is for Security. Never treat browser constraints as a data integrity defense.

## 5. Responsive Design and Typography

### Guidelines

- **DO** use single-column layouts for scanning.
- **DO** set `font-size` to at least `1rem` (16px) to prevent iOS zoom.
- **DO** expand clickable areas for mobile tap targets using padding tricks.
- **DO** ensure tap targets are at least `48px`.
- **DO** use units relative to root (`rem`) and unitless `line-height`.
- **DO** use CSS logical properties (e.g., `margin-inline-start`) for RTL support.

### Code Example

```css
.form-group {
  margin-block-end: 1.5rem;
}

/* Expand clickable tap area without layout shift */
label {
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 10px 0;
  margin: -10px 0;
}

input {
  font-size: 1rem;
  padding: 0.75rem;
  min-height: 48px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

@media (pointer: coarse) {
  input {
    min-height: 52px;
  }
}
```

## 6. Styling Form Controls

### Guidelines

- **DO** use `accent-color` for quick branding of native radios/checkboxes.
- **DO** use `appearance: none` for custom dropdown arrows without breaking semantics.
- **DO** ensure inputs are clearly visible with adequate border contrast (e.g., `#ccc` or darker on white backgrounds).
- **DO** hide inputs visually using the canonical `.visually-hidden` recipe (`clip-path: inset(50%)` with 1px dimensions) — NOT `display: none`, which removes them from the accessibility tree.

### Code Example

```html
<div class="checkbox-container">
  <input type="checkbox" id="sub" name="sub" class="visually-hidden">
  <label for="sub" class="checkbox-label">Subscribe</label>
</div>

<style>
  .visually-hidden {
    position: absolute;
    clip-path: inset(50%);
    overflow: hidden;
    width: 1px;
    height: 1px;
    margin: -1px;
    padding: 0;
    border: 0;
    white-space: nowrap;
  }
  .checkbox-label::before {
    content: "";
    display: inline-block;
    width: 1.25rem;
    height: 1.25rem;
    border: 2px solid #ccc;
  }
  input:focus-visible + .checkbox-label::before {
    outline: 2px solid #0b57d0;
  }
</style>
```

## 7. JavaScript and AJAX

### Guidelines

- **DO** prevent default navigation on form submit for AJAX (`e.preventDefault()`).
- **DO** use `ValidityState` interfaces for real-time validation checks.
- **DO** use `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` for dynamic UI reveals.

- **DON'T** block page submission if JS fails; ensure server-side fallback.

### Code Example

```js
form.addEventListener('submit', (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  const data = new FormData(form);
  // fetch('/submit', { method: 'POST', body: data });
});
```

## 8. Identity, Payments, and Advanced Security

### Guidelines

- **DO** use `autocomplete="new-password"` for sign-up and `autocomplete="current-password"` for sign-in.
- **DO** allow pasting into password fields.
- **DO** provide a toggle capability allowing users to unmask password input.
- **DO** indicate exact amounts on pay buttons (e.g., "Pay $100").
- **DO** use `autocomplete="cc-number"`, `cc-exp`, `cc-csc`.
- **DO** use HTTPS for all pages.
- **DO** implement cryptographically secure anti-CSRF tokens for mutating actions (POST/PUT/DELETE).
- **DO** sanitize user input (e.g., via DOMPurify) before injecting it into the DOM to prevent XSS.
- **DO** implement spam protection (honeypots or CAPTCHA) for open forms.

- **DON'T** utilize HTTP `GET` for endpoints executing state changes.
- **DON'T** use inline JavaScript (e.g., `onclick="..."`) directly within form markup to satisfy strict Content Security Policies (CSP).

### Code Example

```html
<form method="post">
  <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="secure_token_abc123">

  <h1>Sign up</h1>

  <div class="form-group">        
    <label for="name">Full name</label>
    <input id="name" name="name" autocomplete="name" required pattern="[\p{L}\.\- ]+">
  </div>

  <div class="form-group">        
    <label for="email">Email</label>
    <input id="email" name="email" type="email" autocomplete="username" required>
  </div>

  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="password">Password</label>
    <button id="toggle-password" type="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-label="Show password" aria-describedby="toggle-warning">
      <img class="icon-eye" src="/icons/eye.svg" alt="" width="20" height="20">
      <img class="icon-eye-off" src="/icons/eye-off.svg" alt="" width="20" height="20">
    </button>
    <span id="toggle-warning" class="visually-hidden">Warning: this will display your password on the screen.</span>
    <input id="password" name="password" type="password" autocomplete="new-password" minlength="8" aria-describedby="password-constraints" required>
    <div id="password-constraints">Eight or more characters.</div>
  </div>

  <button id="sign-up">Sign up</button>
</form>
```


## 9. Address Collection

### Guidelines

- **DO** use a single field for names.
- **DO** use `autocomplete="street-address"`.
- If the site has users in different countries, **DO** use the `<textarea>` element for addresses, to accommodate different address formats in different geographical regions. If the form uses separate inputs for address parts (e.g. Street, City), **DO** use `autocomplete` values `address-line1`, `address-line2`, etc.
- **DO** make postal codes optional.

- **DON'T** split name inputs into rigid variables ("First", "Last") for global audiences.
- **DON'T** enforce Latin-only characters for names and usernames.

### Code Example

```html
<!-- Accessible Address Form with Autofill -->
<form action="/save-address" method="POST">
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="full-name">Full name</label>
    <input type="text" id="full-name" name="full_name" maxlength="100" required autocomplete="name">
  </div>

  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="address">Address</label>
    <textarea id="address" name="address" required autocomplete="street-address" maxlength="300"></textarea>
  </div>

  <button type="submit">Save Address</button>
</form>
```


## 10. Usability Testing and Analytics

### Guidelines

- **DO** test forms across multiple devices, browsers, and screen sizes.
- **DO** test keyboard-only navigation (using `Tab` and `Shift+Tab`) and verify visual focus.
- **DO** emulate various impairments (visual, motor) using browser tools.
- **DO** use analytics to monitor form completion rates and bounce points.
- **DO** track discrete events (e.g., field focus, click) to find micro-friction points.

- **DON'T** rely solely on automated tools (Lighthouse) for usability; test with real users.
- **DON'T** track sensitive personal data in standard event labels.

### Code Example

```html
<form action="/submit" method="POST" id="track-form">
  <label for="postal-code">ZIP or postal code</label>
  <input type="text" id="postal-code" name="postal-code" autocomplete="postal-code" maxlength="20" required>
  <button type="submit" id="submit-btn">Submit</button>
</form>

<script>
  const trackForm = document.getElementById('track-form');
  const trackBtn = document.getElementById('submit-btn');
  
  trackBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
    console.log('Analytics Event: Submit clicked');
  });
</script>
```

## 11. Multi-Page Forms

### Guidelines

- **DO** clearly display progress through a multi-page form with clear labels and progress indicators.
- **DO** allow users to navigate backwards and forwards between pages.
- **DO** use context-specific `enterkeyhint` values (e.g., `"previous"`, `"next"`) to guide navigation via on-screen keyboards.
- **DO** design layouts so that the mobile keyboard does not obscure inputs or buttons (e.g., by placing them in the upper half of the viewport when focused or using CSS scroll-padding).

### Code Example

```html
<nav aria-label="Progress">
  <ol class="progress-tracker">
    <li class="step-done">Step 1: Account</li>
    <li class="step-active" aria-current="step">Step 2: Shipping</li>
    <li class="step-todo">Step 3: Payment</li>
  </ol>
</nav>

<button type="button" onclick="history.back()" enterkeyhint="previous">Previous</button>
<button type="submit" enterkeyhint="next">Next</button>
```

# Accessibility Coding Guidelines

This guide provides actionable DOs and DON'Ts for AI coding agents to ensure web applications are accessible to all users, including those using assistive technologies.

Keep these principles in mind throughout:

- **Accessibility is the minimum, not the ceiling.** Conformance to standards is the floor; aim for genuine usability.
- **Patterns are use-case specific.** No checklist replaces real testing — including testing with disabled users — to confirm a given implementation is actually accessible in context.

## 1. Content Navigability and Structure

### Actionable Guidelines

#### DOs
- **Place all content within landmarks**: Wrap the page in `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` so assistive-tech users can jump between regions.
- **Structure main content with headings**: Use `<h1>`–`<h6>` sequentially (no jumping `<h1>` → `<h4>`) so screen-reader users get a navigable outline.
- **Use lists for repeated, contiguous content**: `<ul>`/`<ol>` give assistive tech a count up front and let users skip the entire group.
- **Provide skip links** prior to repeated content like site headers with navigation or long/infinite lists, so that keyboard users can easily bypass them. Make sure the target is focusable (e.g. `<main id="content" tabindex="-1">`).
- **Semantic Tables**: Use `<caption>` and `<th scope="col">` (or `<th scope="row">`) for data tables.

#### DON'Ts
- **Don't use fake headings**: Never style `<div>` or `<span>` to look like headings without standard `<h1>`–`<h6>` tags.
- **Don't place headings inside `<summary>`, and avoid relying on headings inside `<details>` content**: Headings inside `<summary>` may be hidden from screen-reader heading lists and heading-navigation shortcuts entirely; headings inside `<details>` content are only reachable via heading navigation when the disclosure is open.
  - **Caveat**: If a heading must act as a disclosure trigger, use a more robust alternative to `<details>`/`<summary>` instead, e.g. an accordion or a disclosure implemented with ARIA where the heading wraps the button.
- **Don't use tables for layout**: Use CSS Grid/Flexbox for visual layouts.
- **Don't overuse landmarks**: Too many landmarks dilute their value. In particular, avoid labeling a `<section>` (which turns it into a `region` landmark) — `region` should be a last resort when no other landmark fits.

### Code Examples

```html
<!-- Good: Semantic landmarks, heading hierarchy, skip link -->
<header>
  <a href="#content" class="skip-link visually-hidden">Skip to content</a>
  <nav aria-label="Primary">
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>
<main id="content" tabindex="-1">
  <h1>Platform Dashboard</h1>
  <section>
    <h2>User Statistics</h2>
    <table>
      <caption>Monthly active users</caption>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col">Month</th>

## 2. Semantic HTML and ARIA

### Actionable Guidelines

#### DOs
- **Prefer HTML elements and attributes to ARIA**: A native element comes with the right role and behavior. `<button>` already implies `role="button"`; `required` already implies `aria-required`.
- **Match ARIA implementations to actual behavior**: If you set `role="tab"`, the element must behave like a tab — including keyboard interactions. Many ARIA patterns can't be implemented in CSS alone and need JavaScript.
- **Be deliberate about `disabled` vs `aria-disabled`**: `disabled` removes the element from the focus order entirely (and `tabindex="0"` won't bring it back), which is often wrong for toolbar buttons or links. `aria-disabled="true"` keeps the element focusable so users can land on it and learn it's disabled.

#### DON'Ts
- **Don't use ARIA when native HTML exists**: Avoid `<div role="button">` or `<a role="button">` if `<button>` works.
- **Don't add redundant ARIA roles or properties**: Avoid `<ul role="list">`, `<nav role="navigation">`, or `<input required aria-required="true">`.
  - **Caveat**: Safari removes list semantics from `<ul>`/`<ol>` outside `<nav>` when `list-style: none` or `display: flex`/`grid` is applied. In that case `role="list"` is required to restore them.
- **Don't assume custom elements have no ARIA**: Custom elements can attach ARIA via `ElementInternals`, which some automated test tools can't see — so the absence of `role`/`aria-*` attributes in markup doesn't prove the element has no semantics. Verify with the browser's accessibility-tree inspector.

## 3. Accessible Names and Descriptions

Every interactive element and some landmarks need an accessible name, and many benefit from an accessible description. Names are short and identify the element; descriptions add context.

### Actionable Guidelines

#### DOs
- **Prefer native naming mechanisms**: `<label>` for form controls, `<caption>` for `<table>`, `<legend>` for `<fieldset>`, `<figcaption>` for `<figure>`.
- **Explicitly associate `<label>` with its control via `for`/`id`**, even when nesting the input inside the label — explicit association improves assistive-tech support.
- **Prefer `aria-labelledby` over `aria-label` when a visible label exists**: avoids duplication, improves maintainability, and translates better.
- **Prefer to reuse the same accessible name for hyperlinks that share an `href`.**
- **Use visually hidden text to disambiguate controls** that look identical visually but do different things (e.g. multiple "Edit" buttons in a list).

#### DON'Ts
- **Don't put `aria-label`/`aria-labelledby` on elements that shouldn't be named** — e.g. plain `<div>`, `<span>`, or custom elements without a role. Custom elements may have an implicit role set via `ElementInternals`, so the absence of a `role` attribute isn't conclusive.
- **Don't reuse an accessible name across controls with different effects in the same view** (close buttons for two different open dialogs are fine because only one is reachable at a time; multiple “Edit” buttons for different content is not).
- **Don't reuse an accessible name across hyperlinks pointing to different `href`s.**
- **Don't pack descriptions, error messages, or instructions into the label.**
- **Don't repeat state already exposed via ARIA** (`aria-expanded`, `aria-checked`, `aria-selected`, `aria-pressed`) inside the accessible name — it creates redundancy and ambiguity.
- **Don't include the role name in the label**: `<nav aria-label="Primary navigation">` reads as "Primary navigation navigation."
- **Don't use `title` or `placeholder` as a naming mechanism.**
- **Don't include interactive elements in an `aria-describedby` target** unless their text content reads sensibly as a description on its own (e.g. if a link’s text is the same as how it’s labelled elsewhere, it can be included within a description).

### Code Example: Visually Hidden Utility

A `.visually-hidden` utility lets you provide text for screen readers without rendering it visually. It's commonly used for skip links, additional context on icon-only buttons, and supplementary labels.

```css
/* Hides content visually but keeps it in the accessibility tree.
   :focus-within / :active opt elements out — useful for skip links and
   any focusable content wrapped in this class. */
.visually-hidden:where(:not(:focus-within, :active)) {
  position: absolute !important;
  clip-path: inset(50%) !important;
  overflow: hidden !important;
  width: 1px !important;
  height: 1px !important;
  margin: -1px !important;
  padding: 0 !important;
  border: 0 !important;
  white-space: nowrap !important;
}
```

When the hidden content is focusable (skip links, focus-receiving wrappers), the `:focus-within`/`:active` exception lets it become visible. Style the visible state per situation, e.g. a skip link to the main content typically wants fixed positioning at the top-left of the viewport so the rest of the page doesn't shift.

## 4. Document Metadata and Language

### Actionable Guidelines

#### DOs
- **Declare Visual Language**: Always set `<html lang="en">` (or appropriate code).
- **Unique Page Titles**: Front-load unique context in `<title>` (e.g., `Page Topic | Site Name`).
- **Inline Language Switches**: Use `lang="..."` for block quotes or text in different languages.
- **IFrame Titles**: Always provide a descriptive `title="..."` for `<iframe>` elements.
- **Update document title on Page Transitions in SPAs**: Shift focus to updated titles.

#### DON'Ts
- **Don't Disable iframe Scrolling**: Avoid `scrolling="no"` (deprecated) or `overflow: hidden` on iframes. Users who zoom in or enlarge text need to scroll to reach content that overflows.

### Code Examples

```html
<!-- Good: Distinct title and language declaration -->
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>Analytics Reports | Guidance Platform</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>The motto is <span lang="la">"Carpe diem"</span>.</p>
  <iframe title="Interactive Sales Chart" src="/chart"></iframe>
</body>
</html>
```

## 5. Keyboard and Focus Management

### Actionable Guidelines

#### DOs
- **Logical Tab Order**: Ensure tab order matches visual layouts (top-to-bottom).
- **Visible Focus Indicators**: Always style `:focus-visible` states explicitly. If disabling defaults, provide overrides with sufficient contrast.
- **Custom Trigger Keyboards**: Attach Enter/Space handlers for custom simulated interactive elements. When implementing a custom keyboard handler for button-like elements, `Enter` should be a `keydown` handler and `Space` should be a `keyup` handler (matching native `<button>` behavior where `Enter` repeats and `Space` triggers on release).
- **Use `tabindex` deliberately**: Anything focusable — by keyboard or programmatically — should have an implicit or explicit ARIA role, so don't make every element focusable. When focus is needed, choose `tabindex="0"` to add the element to the tab order or `tabindex="-1"` to make it programmatically focusable only (e.g., a skip-link target).
- **Manage Toggle States**: Utilize `aria-expanded` and `aria-pressed` to communicate toggle states for custom controls.

#### DON'Ts
- **Don't disable outlines without replacements**: Avoid `outline: none` without styling alternatives.
- **Don't use Positive Tabindex values**: Never use `tabindex="1"` or greater.
- **Don't hide interactive elements from screen readers**: Avoid `aria-hidden="true"` or `role="presentation"` on elements that can receive focus.

### Code Examples

```css
/* Good: High contrast focus border */
:where(a:any-link, button):focus-visible {
  outline: 3px solid #ff0055;
  outline-offset: 3px;
}
```

```html
<!-- Good: Skip to main content -->
<a href="#content" class="skip-link">Skip to main content</a>
<main id="content" tabindex="-1">...</main>
```

```javascript
// Good: Keyboard handlers for complex custom widgets (e.g., Tree items, tabs).
// NOTE: This pattern applies ONLY to non-standard UI where no native HTML tag exists.
// Always prioritize native <button> or <input> elements for standard interactions.
// Elements MUST have the appropriate ARIA role (e.g., role="treeitem" or role="tab").
customWidget.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {
  if (e.key === 'Enter') {
    toggleWidgetState();
  }
  if (e.key === ' ') {
    e.preventDefault(); // Prevent page scrolling on Spacebar keydown
  }
});

customWidget.addEventListener('keyup', (e) => {
  if (e.key === ' ') {
    toggleWidgetState();
  }
});

function toggleWidgetState() {
  // E.g., Manage toggle/expanded states for custom controls
  const isExpanded = customWidget.getAttribute('aria-expanded') === 'true';
  customWidget.setAttribute('aria-expanded', !isExpanded);
}
```

## 6. Alternate Text and Media

### Actionable Guidelines

#### DOs
- **Informative Visual Descriptions**: Describe the purpose of the image (e.g., "Search", not "Magnifying glass").
- **Empty Alt properties for decorative visuals**: Use `alt=""` to remove decorative images from the accessibility tree so they aren't announced.
- **Synchronous Captions for videos**: Supply WebVTT captions for video tracks.
- **Transcripts for audio**: Provide text transcripts for purely audio podcasts.
- **Informative View Descriptions for inline SVGs**: Apply `role="img"` and a nested `<title>` tag for informative visuals.
- **Decorative SVGs removal**: Apply `aria-hidden="true"` to remove decorative SVGs from reading flows.
- **Long descriptions for complex images**: Use `<figure>`/`<figcaption>` or `aria-describedby` for charts and infographics.
- **Provide data tables as alternatives**: Consider providing semantic data tables as accessible alternatives for charts and other complex data visualizations.

#### DON'Ts
- **Don't use clichéd prefixes**: Avoid "Image of..." or "Picture of...".
- **Don't use underscores in filenames**: Use dashes if the filename might be announced as fallback.

### Code Examples

```html
<!-- Decorative -->
<img src="divider.png" alt="">

<!-- Inline Decorative SVG (remove from tab flow) -->
<svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
  <path d="M10 20v-6h4v6h5v-8h3L12 3 2 12h3v8z"/>
</svg>

<!-- Informative (Functional) -->
<a href="/search">
  <img src="glass.png" alt="Search the platform">
</a>

<!-- Video with Captions tracks -->
<video controls>
  <source src="intro.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <track src="caps.vtt" kind="captions" srclang="en" label="English">
</video>

<!-- Complex graph with figcaption -->
<figure>
  <img src="chart.png" alt="Sales growth graph 2024.">
  <figcaption>Sales grew 20% in Q3 due to new platform launch.</figcaption>
</figure>

<!-- Audio with expandable transcript details -->
<audio controls src="podcast.mp3" aria-details="podcast-transcript"></audio>
<details id="podcast-transcript">
  <summary>View Transcript</summary>
  <div class="transcript-content">
    Welcome to the show...
  </div>
</details>
```

### Content Visibility Decision Matrix

| Intent | Visual | Screen Reader | Focusable | Structural Pattern |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Visible to all** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Standard rendering |
| **Screen Reader only** | No | Yes | Yes (if interactive) | Visually hidden utility (e.g. `.visually-hidden`) |
| **Visual only** | Yes | No | No | `aria-hidden="true"` / `role="presentation"` |
| **Hidden for all** | No | No | No | `hidden` attribute / `display: none` |

**Heuristic Rule**: If an element can receive keyboard focus, it must not be hidden via `aria-hidden="true"`.

## 7. Forms and Input Controls

### Actionable Guidelines

#### DOs
- **Connect Labels Programmatically**: Use `<label for="id">` linked to `<input id="id">`.
- **Use Autocomplete**: Set valid standard `autocomplete` options (e.g., `"email"` or `"given-name"`) for user profiles.
- **Link hints to inputs via `aria-describedby`**: Associate help text with inputs, and place the hint above the input so autocomplete popovers don't cover it during editing.
- **Announce dynamic errors via live regions**: Use `aria-live` or shift focus to error lists.
- **Provide form validation constraints**: Use `required` (or `aria-required="true"` only when `required` isn't applicable) to signal mandatory inputs.

#### DON'Ts
- **Don't use placeholders as labels**: Placeholders are not persistent labels.
- **Don't trigger context shifts on focus changes**: Avoid auto-submitting forms or jumping pages on focus change events alone.

### Code Examples

```html
<!-- Good: Semantic forms with hints for passwords -->
<form>
  <label for="pwd">Password:</label>
  <span id="pwd-hint">Must contain at least 8 characters.</span>
  <input id="pwd" type="password" aria-describedby="pwd-hint" autocomplete="current-password" required>
</form>
```

## 8. Live Regions

Live regions let assistive tech announce content updates that aren't tied to navigation or focus changes. They're easy to misuse — too many regions, or noisy ones, quickly become spam for screen-reader users.

### Live Region Urgency Table

| Urgency | Visual Analogue | `aria-live` Value | Behavioral Impact | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Critical** | Modal / Alert | `assertive` (or `role="alert"`) | Interrupts immediately, clears speech queue | Session timeout, API failure |
| **Standard**| Toast / Banner | `polite` | Announces at next graceful break | Search results, "Saved" status |
| **Passive**  | Silent text | `off` | Only if user navigates to it | Live character count |

**Heuristic Rule**: Use `assertive` only for critical, time-sensitive updates that require immediate attention or prevent safe continuation (e.g., data loss, session timeouts, or network drops).

### Actionable Guidelines

#### DOs
- **Centralize live regions for non-visible announcements**: A single `polite` region and a single `assertive` region per page (with whatever `aria-atomic` configuration you need) keeps announcements consistent and easier to maintain. Many frameworks ship their own announcer abstraction — use it.
- **Debounce frequently-changing regions**: If a region can update many times per second (e.g. a combobox's result count as the user types), debounce so users aren't spammed.
- **Delay slightly when other announcements may collide**: When the user is typing or focus is being managed, a small delay before announcing keeps live-region updates from overlapping other speech.

#### DON'Ts
- **Don't use live regions for interstitial states** like "Loading…" or "Updating…" unless they're meaningfully informative — they usually just create noise.
- **Don't add live-region updates to inert DOM**: When dialogs open or sections become `inert`, queued or debounced messages can end up unannounced — or announced from DOM the user can't reach. Coordinate live-region updates with dialog/inert state changes.

### Code Example

```html
<!-- Session Timeout Warning with controls -->
<div role="alert" class="timeout-warning">
  Your session will expire in 2 minutes. 
  <button type="button" onclick="extendSession()">Extend Session</button>
</div>
```

## 9. Color, Contrast, and Typography

### Actionable Guidelines

#### DOs
- **Minimum contrast standards**: Maintain 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text or icons.
- **Ensure non-text contrast standards**: Maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 3:1 for user interface component boundaries and states.
  - This includes visual elements (borders, backgrounds, box-shadows, underlines) that form the boundary or indicate the presence of a UI component (e.g., input field borders).
  - This also includes visual elements indicating active states within a component (e.g., checkbox checkmarks or switch thumbs).
  - **Caveat**: Meeting 3:1 non-text contrast can challenge minimalistic designs. Soft gradients or subtle inset/outset shadows can soften visual boundaries while satisfying accessibility requirements.
- **Use multiple state indicators**: Do not denote success/errors ONLY with color. Use icons or text.
- **Relative font size units**: Use `rem` or `em` for font sizes instead of `px`.
- **Consistent or Start alignment**: Avoid `justify` alignment as it can be more difficult to read.
- **Avoid long lines of text**: Cap paragraph blocks to a maximum of 80 characters width.
- **Support user zoom preferences**: Allow users to resize text up to 200% without loss of content or functionality.
- **Support light and dark color schemes**: Honor `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` and pair it with the `color-scheme` CSS property so form controls, scrollbars, and other UA-rendered surfaces match.
- **Use `prefers-contrast` only when warranted**: Reach for `@media (prefers-contrast: more)` when the design uses low-contrast accents (e.g., subtle borders, muted secondary text) that need to be reinforced; most sites that already meet baseline contrast won't need it.

#### DON'Ts
- **Don't use color alone to indicate the presence of a user interface component or its state**: Use iconography and/or shape to help differentiate.
- **Don't use Justified Text Alignment**: Avoid `text-align: justify`.
- **Don't use Ornate fonts**: Omit cursive typefaces for main reading content.
- **Don't rely on all-caps for emphasis**: Prefer bolding for visual emphasis, and use `<em>`/`<strong>` when the emphasis is semantic.
- **Limit emphasis overall**: Emphasis loses meaning when it's everywhere — apply it only where it changes how the content should be read.

### Code Examples

```css
/* Good: Relative sizing and line caps */
body {
  line-height: 1.5;
  text-align: start; /* Supports LTR and RTL */
}
article {
  max-width: 80ch; /* Caps line length to ~80 characters for readability */
}
```

```html
<!-- Good: Denotes state without colors alone -->
<div class="error-msg">
  <span aria-hidden="true">❌</span>
  <span>The password entered was invalid.</span>
</div>
```

```css
/* Dark Mode support variables */
:root {
  --bg-color: #ffffff;
  --text-color: #212529;
}
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --bg-color: #121212;
    --text-color: #f8f9fa;
  }
}
```

## 10. Motions and Preferences

### Actionable Guidelines

#### DOs
- **Support Reduced Motion media queries**: Support `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` media queries.
- **Provide Pause mechanism**: Allow users to stop auto-running carousels banners or other persistent animations.
- **Default to static views**: Consider defaulting to static states and allowing users to opt-in to motion.

#### DON'Ts
- **Don't exceed flash limits (three per second)**: Never include rapid light-to-dark flashing. Such effects can cause seizures.

### Code Examples

```css
/* Good: Dampen spin states for reduced motion queries */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .spinner {
    animation: none;
    opacity: 0.5;
  }
}
```

## 11. Modals and Native Dialogs

Modern browsers provide native solutions for creating modal dialogs which avoid the need for focus traps, managing the accessibility of outside content, ensuring the content is on top, and dimming the background content — all of which can be error prone and require heavy JavaScript event tracking to maintain.

### Actionable Guidelines

#### DOs
- **Use the Native `<dialog>` Element**: Invoke the dialog using the `.showModal()` method to open it in a modal state. When in a modal state, the browser sets outside content as inert (i.e. the outside content is hidden from the accessibility tree and cannot be interacted with nor be focused).
- **Use the `inert` Attribute for Custom Overlays**: When `<dialog>` cannot be used (e.g., some non-modal overlays, framework constraints, or layouts where `<dialog>`'s top-layer/positioning behavior conflicts with the design), apply `inert` to outside content to ensure it cannot be interacted with by keyboard, pointer, or assistive technology. This requires structuring elements in such a way that the custom overlay is not a descendant of the element with `inert` set on it.

#### DON'Ts
- **Don't implement focus traps for native modal dialogs**: When a `<dialog>` element is opened in a modal state, browsers set outside content as inert which is sufficient for ensuring only the dialog’s content can be focused.

### Code Examples

**HTML & JS: Native `<dialog>` with standard close events**
```html
<!-- Dialog opens natively with showModal() and locks focus -->
<button id="open-btn">Open Dialog</button>

<dialog id="accessible-modal" aria-labelledby="title-id">
  <h2 id="title-id">Account Settings</h2>
  <p>Update your details here.</p>
  <button onclick="this.closest('dialog').close()">Close Dialog</button>
</dialog>

<script>
  document.getElementById('open-btn').addEventListener('click', () => {
    document.getElementById('accessible-modal').showModal();
  });
</script>
```

## 12. Testing Validations

### Actionable Guidelines

#### DOs
- **Run Automated checks via axe-core or Lighthouse audits**: Catch missing alt texts or low contrasts (e.g., via Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools MCP).
- **Validate Sequential Navigations using keyboards alone**: Using only keyboard shortcuts, such as Tab/Shift+Tab, arrow keys, Enter, Space, and Esc, confirm every interactive element is reachable and operable, and that focus never gets stuck.
- **Test on Screen Readers with calibrated browsers**: Rely on standard bindings (e.g., JAWS with Chrome, NVDA with Firefox, Narrator with Edge, VoiceOver with Safari on macOS and iOS, TalkBack with Chrome for Android).

#### DON'Ts
- **Don't rely purely on scores**: A 100% score does not guarantee real usability.
